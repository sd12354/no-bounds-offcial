  <h2>Our Goal</h2>
  <p id="ourGoal">When we decided to create no BOUNDS, we had the goal to make clothing and accesories that were both stylish and had a deeper meaning behind them. And so we decided that for each drop we have we will donate a portion of our profits to a specific non profit charity that is devoted to making the world a better place. If you are curious about what charity we are donating to for our first release it is <a href="https://colorofchange.org/" style="color: black; border-bottom: none;">Color of Change</a> On all of our clothing products we have a little message printed on there so make sure to take a look when you recieve your order. <br> <br> The journey of this brand has been a long one, but we are happy with how it has gone so far. We are always designing new clothing pieces and accessories and hope to only expand and improve upon ourselves. When you support us you are also helping make a change and you should give yourself a pat on the back. <br> <br> Lastly, we want to say thank to everyone who has supported us over the last few months, and any support is appreciated so make sure to tune in on September 3rd, 2022 at 6 PM EST for our first release! (P.S we may decide to bless some early supporters with free posters and early access, so make sure to follow us on all our socials and join the discord)</p>
